## Required Python Libraries

Use the requirements.txt file to install all the required dependencies to run the code.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Dataset Descrption
Human activity recognition using smartphone data using dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, They captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

## Algorithm Descrption
For project demontration we used Logsitic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest,Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks for human activity recognition. We found out that Neural Netowrks performed the best in classifying different activities with accuracy of almost 96%.
